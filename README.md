## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. The game should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking. The functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

To see the app's functionality, open `js/app.js`, `js/engine.js`, `js/resources.js`.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## How to Play

You should be able to move the player from the grass across the stone block to the water. There are enemy bugs that the player should avoid in order to reach the water. Once the Player gets to the water, he/she gets teleported to the starting point(grass).

To make the game more interesting, the player has been given 3 attempts indicated as lives with which he should use to try and collect 5 Gems before they are over. Each collision between player and gem results in loss of one life. If the player successfully collects all the gems, a congratulation message displays on the screen. If the player's life is over before collecting all the gems, a message appears to the player indicating that he can try again. The reset button on the modal resets the game to the begining with the total number of lives and gems.
